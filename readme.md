This is a work-in-progress command-line program to play and edit
tracks written in a visually-clear text file format.

The goal is to create a system that allows for both real-time
and programmatic editing of tracks that can later be used in
other Lua-based systems with audio, with the first planned
target being the LÃ¶ve game engine.
